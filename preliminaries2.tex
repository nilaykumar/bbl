\chapter{Preliminaries}

\blurb{We begin with a review of derivations and differential operators in the local case. 
    We then introduce the sheaf $\mathscr{D}_X$ and study basic properties of $\mathscr{D}_X$-modules.}

\section{Local constructions}

\begin{definition}
    We say that a commutative ring $R$ is \textbf{affine} if it is
    the coordinate ring of an affine complex algebraic variety, i.e.
    if $R$ is an integral domain of finite type over $\C$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Let $R$ be affine, and $M,N$ two $R$-modules.\sidenote{The affine condition is not strictly necessary
    for many of our definitions,
    but it will be useful when working over complex algebraic varieties.}
    We define the module of
    differential operators $\Diff_R(M,N)$ from $M$ to $N$ to be the homomorphisms $d\in\Hom_\C(M,N)$
    such that there exists an $k\in\N$ with any set of $k+1$ elements of $R$ satisfying
    \begin{equation}
        (\ad r_0)(\ad r_1)\cdots(\ad r_k)(d)=0,
        \label{eq:ad}
    \end{equation}
    where $(\ad r)(d)=[r,d]=rd-dr$. In this case, we say that $d$ is of order $\leqslant k$.
    Note that the submodule of differential operators of order $\leqslant 0$, in particular,
    is simply $\Hom_R(M,N)$. We will write $D(R)$ for the module $\Diff_R(R,R)\subset\End_{\C}(R,R)$.
    \label{def:derivations}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    The order of a differential operator provides a natural filtration of the module $\Diff_R(M,N)$.
    This yields the following inductive definition of $\Diff_R(M,N)$, equivalent to the one
    above\sidenote{In this formulation, these are typically known as Grothendieck differential
    operators.}: % TODO should we mention the other definition using im(R->Hom(M,N))?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[] $\Diff^{i}_R(M,N) = 0; \;\;\;(i<0)$
        \item[] $\Diff^k_R(M,N) = \{u\in\Hom_\C(M,N)\mid (\ad r)(u)\in \Diff^{k-1}_R(M,N)\};$
        \item[] $\Diff_R(M,N)=\bigcup_k\Diff^k_R(M,N)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
    The module $D(R)=\Diff_R(R,R)$ forms a filtered ring under composition of
    differential operators.
    \label{lemma:filtration}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    That $D(R)$ forms a ring is clear; it suffices to show that $D^i(R)\cdot D^j(R)\subset D^{i+j}(R)$.
    If we have $\alpha\in D^i(R),\beta\in D^j(R),r\in R$, then
    \[ [\alpha\beta,r] = \alpha\beta r-r\alpha\beta = \alpha[\beta,r] +[\alpha,r]\beta.  \]
    Now $[\alpha,r]$ is of order $\leqslant (i-1)$ and $[\beta,r]$ is of order $\leqslant(j-1)$, so induction
    yields the case of degree $i$ times an $R$-linear endomorphism $f$ (of degree zero). Now
    \[ [\alpha f, r]=\alpha fr-r\alpha f=\alpha rf-r\alpha f=[\alpha,r]f, \]
    so another induction yields the case of the product two $R$-linear endomorphisms, which is another
    $R$-linear endomorphism, hence degree $0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    Let $M$ be an $R$-module. Recall that $\Der_\C(R,M)$ is the (left) $R$-module of $\C$-module homomorphisms
    $\delta:R\to M$ satisfying the product rule $\delta(rs)=r\delta(s)+\delta(r)s.$
    The \textbf{derivation ring} $\Delta(R)$ of $R$ is the subring of $\End_\C(R,R)$ generated
    by $R$ and $\Der_\C(R,R)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    The derivation ring $\Delta(R)$, under the filtration where $\Delta^i(R)$ is the
    $R$-submodule generated by all products of at most $i$ derivations, is a filtered
    subring of the ring of differential operators $D(R)$.
    \label{lemma:filtsubring}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    It is clear that $\Delta^i(R)\cdot\Delta^j(R)\subset\Delta^{i+j}(R)$,\sidenote{In fact,
    we have equality.} so the filtration on $\Delta(R)$ is well-defined. It remains to show
    that $[\Delta^i(R),r]\subset\Delta^{i-1}(R)$. We proceed inductively: the result clearly
    holds for $i=0$. Now suppose it holds for some $i-1$ and let $d\in\Delta^{i}(R)$. Assume,
    without loss of generality, that we can write $d=d_1\cdots d_i$ with each
    $d_j\in\Der_\C(R)$.\sidenote{In general, $\Delta^i(R)$ is a sum of terms
    each with a product of a different number $\leqslant i$ of derivations.
    We can drop all terms with fewer than $i$ derivations by the induction step.}
    Then, for $r,s\in R$, we find that
    \begin{align*}
        [d_1\cdots d_i,r]s &= d_1\cdots d_irs-rd_1\cdots d_is\\
        &= d_1\cdots d_{i-1}rd_is+d_1\cdots d_{i-1}[d_i,r]s-rd_1\cdots d_is\\
        &= \left([d_1\cdots d_{i-1},r]d_i+d_1\cdots d_{i-1}[d_i,r]\right)s.
    \end{align*}
    The term in parentheses, by the induction step, lives in $\Delta^{i-1}(R)$,
    and hence $[\Delta^i(R),r]\subset\Delta^{i-1}(R)$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[Weyl algebra]
    % TODO write this
    Define the Weyl algebra and show that in this case the two algebras are
    isomorphic.
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}
    The inclusion $\Delta(R)\subset D(R)$ induces an isomorphism of
    $R$-modules $\Delta^1(R)\cong D^1(R)$.
    \label{label:firstorder}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    By definition, $\Delta^1(R)\cong R\oplus\Der_\C R\subset D^1(R)$. Take any $\alpha\in D^1(R)$
    and let $\beta=\alpha-\alpha(1)$. By definition, $[ [\beta,r],s]=0$ for any $r,s\in R$.
    Evaluating both sides of this equation on 1, we find
    \[0 = \beta(rs)-r\beta(s)-s\beta(r),\]
    i.e. that $\beta$ acts as a derivation. Thus $\alpha=\alpha(1)+\beta\in\Delta^1(R)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    In general, the two algebras are not isomorphic.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
    If $R$ is regular, then the inclusion $\Delta(R)\subset D(R)$ is an isomorphism.
    \label{label:derivationiso}
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
    Show that these are isomorphic for affine space.
\end{example}

Why is this theorem useful? Because we can use the coordinate description of differential
operators in the global sheafified case.

\begin{lemma}
    Let $L$ be an extension field of $\C$ and $K$ be an algebraic extension of $L$. If
    $N$ is a $K$-module then any $f\in\Diff_L(L,N)$ has at most one extension to a
    differential operator in $\Diff_K(K,N)$.
    \label{lemma:hart1}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $g,g'\in\Diff_K(K,N)$ be distinct extensions of $f$, i.e. $g|_L=g'|_L$
but $g\neq g'$. Now $h=g-g'\in\Diff_K(K,N)$ is zero on $L$. For any $a\in K,l\in L$,
we find that
\begin{align*}
    [h,a](l) &= h(al)-ah(l) = h(al)
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    Suppose that $L$ is an extension field of $\C$ and suppose that $K$ is an algebraic
    extension of $L$. Suppose that $f:K\to K$ is a differential operator such that $fw-wf$
    has order $\leqslant p$ for all $w$ in $L$. Then $f$ has order $\leqslant p+1$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $R$ be an affine ring with $S\subset R$ a multiplicatively closed subset
    (not containing zero) and $P\in D^i(R)$ is a differential operator or order $\leqslant i$.
    Denoting the commutator $[P,r]$ by $\ad'(r)(P)$, we claim that if $a,b\in R$
    and $s,t\in S$ such that $at=bs$, then 
    \begin{equation}
        \sum_{j=0}^i(-1)^js^{-j-1}(\ad's)^j(P)(a) = \sum_{j=0}^i (-1)^jt^{-j-1}(\ad't)^j(P)(b)
        \label{eq:loc_diff}
    \end{equation}
    in the localization (under the canonical injection $R\subset S^{-1}R$).
    \label{hart:lemma2}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We induct on the order $i$ of $P$. For $i=0$, proving the above identity amounts to
    showing that $s^{-1}P(a)=t^{-1}P(b)$, which follows immediately from the $R$-linearity
    of zeroth-order differential operators. So suppose that $i\geqslant 1$. Then $(\ad's)(P)$
    has order less than $m$
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
    Explain intuitively this formula for the action of differential operators on the
    localization.
